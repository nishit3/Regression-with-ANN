# Regression-with-ANN
My very first Deep learning model!
 I have randomly generated dependent variable y and independent variable x using torch.randn() with a simple linear relationship.
 A really simple ANN is trained at 500 epochs with 1 neuron in input layer, 1 neuron in output layer and 0 hidden layers.
 ReLU is used as an activation function, and Mean Square Error(MSE) as a loss function.
